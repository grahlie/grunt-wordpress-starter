# grunt-wordpress-starter
This is my personal preferences from the popular underscore wordpress starter kit, I have changed file structure for the WordPress theme files and added docker images to make it work nice & smooth. Have also my prefered task-runner Grunt installed with the repo.

## Start everything up
If you are new to this repo you should first take a look at the config.json file where you can find every settings used across different instances.
After that you should take a look at run.sh and you can fire it up by running ./run.sh dev

When running your website in production you need to create a copy of your config file named `config.prod.json` and run ./run.sh production

## WordPress
Have my own created framework and settings page for this theme installed and other special feature that is pretty standard for starting your WordPress web. Started out with _s so the base of the theme is built on top of that, I dont take any credit for this starter theme instead visit http://underscores.me for more information.
